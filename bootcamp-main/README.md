## About
Some lessons have accompanying starter packs to ensure that all students start with the same code and packages used in the lesson. As well, final packs are included so students can compare their code against the final code in the lesson.

## Setup Instructions
This guide is for the very basic user who has never used git. These instructions will help you clone the entire package and for each starter or final pack, run npm install and npm run dev.

1. First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your operating system if it is not already installed.

2. In order to clone the repository, you need to install Git. Head over to the [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install the appropriate software for your operating system.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the location on your machine where you want to clone the repository. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, you might want to store all your projects in a "projects" directory in your home directory.

``` bash 
cd ~/projects
```
4. Clone the repository with the following command:

``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/enderh3art/ztm-threejs-bootcamp.git
```

This will create a directory named `ztm-threejs-bootcamp` with all the repository content in it.

5. Navigate into the directory:
``` bash 
cd ztm-threejs-bootcamp
```

6. Now, navigate into any lesson directory you want to use (substituting "7_camera_and_renderloop/camera_and_renderloop_starter" with the folder name for the lesson):

``` bash 
cd 7_camera_and_renderloop/camera_and_renderloop_starter
```

7. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies for the lesson:
``` bash 
npm install
```

8. Finally, you can start the local server by running:
``` bash 
npm run dev
```
Congratulations! You are now ready to start the lessons. Repeat steps 6 to 8 for any new lesson.
